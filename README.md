## Brute Force Tools 

Hydra.- We need to know how to use this tool in certain scenarios where the setup can be a little bit more complex. For HTTP brute forcing we’ll need to build a special payload and also take in count that it will change whether it’s a POST or a GET request.

Medusa.- Really similar to Hydra.

Username Anarchy.- Ruby script that generates variations of a name e.g John Doe would generate a list that can help brute force a username

CUPP.- Program that helps generating passwords and if we have extra info (nicknames, city, important people name related to the victim, etc...) it will generate a better list for us.
